Let's work on one of our previous HTML/CSS exercises. Remember, the Page Layout Exercise? Make a copy (copy of what?) so we can create an interactive web page that will take information from the user, and display it to the browser.

This brings our ATM account info to the browser. 

Take a look at the screenshot png file, in this folder. You will recreate this file (css styling is up to you) by coping your atm_objects.js file from the functions and objects lesson, over to your new page layout folder. 

Its time for you to start thinking about how to build your site with html/css and js. There are no step by step instructions for this exercise., change any file in the page layout folder and atm_objects.js. Think about how you can accomplish this task and give it a try.
